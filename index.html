      <p>"Technology, like art, is a soaring exercise of the human imagination" --Daniel Bell</p>

        <p>Julie graduated from John Brown University with a B.S. in Psychology and an A.A. in cross-cultural services.
          After obtaining her master's from The University of Texas at Arlington, she entered the world of
          education, and served as a middle school science teacher. However, after becoming interested in crypto-assets
          and the emerging world of blockchain technology, she decided to embark on a coding career. She is currently enrolled in the SMU Coding Bootcamp and hopes to soon work for an online exchange.</p>
